How to compile (On Ubuntu 16.XX.X):

1. Open terminal and type "mkdir PAC && cd PAC"
2. Type "repo init -u git://github.com/PAC-man/pacman.git -b pac-4.4" to initialize the repo.
3. Copy the files from our "KylessPAC_local_manifests" repo into "(PAC)/.repo/local_manifests"
4. Type "repo sync" and let the ~30GB code download (Find something to do, it will be a while)
5. Check to make sure you followed the steps correctly. Go to "(PAC)/device/samsung/kylessopen" and if this build tree is in there, you are ready to compile!
